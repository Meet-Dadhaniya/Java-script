# This is basic environment setup and how to install node js and how to use basic GitHub (By chai aur code) while learning javascript from chai aur code hitesh sir 













* ## Create a New Folder:



* On your desktop, create a new folder (e.g., "JS-Hindi") (5:56). The name doesn't matter, and the process is the same for Windows, Mac, or Linux (6:06).



* ## Open in VS Code:



* Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is the most popular code editor (14:03-14:10). Other options include Sublime Text (14:33) or WebStorm (14:27), but VS Code is recommended for its features like color coding and auto-indentation (14:38).



* Open VS Code and drag and drop your newly created "JS-Hindi" folder into it (6:35).
* ## 
* ## Create a JavaScript File:



* Inside the "JS-Hindi" folder, create a new file (e.g., test.js) (6:51).
* Write your JavaScript code inside, for example, console.log("Hitesh"); (6:56). The .js extension is crucial as it tells the software what type of file it is (7:16, 8:51).
* ## 
* ## Install Node.js:



* Node.js is the environment that allows you to execute JavaScript files outside of a browser (10:05-10:29, 10:51).
* Go to the official Node.js website (e.g., nodejs.org) (11:13-11:15).
* Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for production-grade environments or the Current version for learning and exploring new features (13:02-13:18).



* Run the installer and follow the prompts (click "Continue" and "Agree" to the license agreement, then "Install") (13:20-13:35).



* ## Execute JavaScript File:



* Open the terminal in VS Code by going to View > Terminal (15:11-15:17).
* First, verify Node.js installation by typing node -v. You should see a version number as output (15:30-15:41).
* To run your JavaScript file, type node followed by the file name (e.g., node test.js) (15:43-15:48).



* ## Online Setup (GitHub Codespaces)
* 
* This method provides a cloud-based development environment, useful if you're working on different computers or have a low-configuration machine (17:11-17:17).



* ## Create a GitHub Account:
* 
* Go to GitHub and create a free account (18:18-18:22).
* Create a New Repository:



* Once logged in, click on "New repository" (18:36).
* Give it a name (e.g., JS-Hindi) (18:42) and an optional description (18:50).
* Keep it Public and check "Add a README file" (19:16).
* Click "Create repository" (19:21).



* ## Open with Codespaces:
* 
* On your new repository page, click on the "Code" button (19:46).
* Select "Codespaces" and then "Create codespace on main" (19:54). This will spin up a cloud-based VS Code environment (20:25-20:34).
* 
* ## Add Dev Container for Node.js:



* In the Codespaces environment, go to File > View > Command Palette (20:54-20:57).
* Type "Container" and select "Add Dev Container Configuration Files" (21:09-21:12).
* Choose "Node.js" when prompted (21:15-21:18).
* Click "Rebuild" when prompted to rebuild the machine with the Node.js environment installed (22:29-22:33).



* ## Create and Execute JavaScript File:



* Once the environment reloads, create a new folder (e.g., 01\_basics) (23:13).
* Inside that folder, create a new file (e.g., test.js) (23:21).
* Add your JavaScript code (e.g., console.log("Hitesh");) (23:28).
* Open the terminal (View > Terminal) (23:38-23:44).
* Execute the file using node 01\_basics/test.js (23:49-23:57).
* Save Changes to GitHub:
* 
* Go to the "Source Control" icon (the fourth icon on the left sidebar) (24:22-24:26).
* Click the "+" icon next to the changed files to stage them (24:30-24:32).
* Write a commit message (e.g., "Container config done") (24:41-24:46).
* Click the triple dots (...) and then "Push" to save your changes to the GitHub repository (24:56-25:01).
* Stop the Codespace:



* To save your free hours, remember to stop the Codespace when you're done. Go to your GitHub Codespaces page, find the running machine, and delete it (25:54-26:21). Your code files are saved on GitHub and can be accessed again by spinning up a new Codespace (26:22-26:29).
